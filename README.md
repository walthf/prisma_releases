# Prisma: Share Your Code Structure with AI in Seconds

Prisma is a tool that instantly generates a hierarchical view of your project structure, allowing you to share clear, contextual information with AI coding assistants.

## The Problem

Explaining your project to AI assistants can be a repetitive and time-consuming process. You often have to dive deep into the problem-solving process and project structure, only to hit token limits and have to start over. Your time is too valuable for this Groundhog Day scenario.

## The Solution: Prisma

Prisma solves this problem by creating a clear, hierarchical view of your project, complete with file paths. This ensures your AI assistant understands not just the content, but the structure and relationships between files at a glance.

## Key Features

- **Smart Hierarchy Mapping**: Generate a tree-like structure of your project
- **Path-Aware Formatting**: Each file is presented with its full path for context
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Automatically exclude irrelevant files and directories
- **Custom Control**: Fine-tune what's included in your project overview
- **One-Click Sharing**: Copy and paste your structured project view instantly
- **Cross-Platform**: Available for Windows and Mac

## How Prisma Works

1. Select your project directory
2. Customize exclusions (if needed)
3. Generate hierarchical structure
4. Share with your AI assistant
